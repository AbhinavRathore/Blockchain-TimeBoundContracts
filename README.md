# Blockchain-TimeBoundContracts
In today's world we are surrounded with the jobs that we can't do ourselves and need service providers. Be it house
construction , products delivery or software contracts. The dependence on the contractors is immense and the situation 
intensifies if our jobs are time-bound. Very often the contractors seem to use the leniency and delay is frequent.
We here tend to provide problem for all such time bound contracts.
The blockchain network proves to be the most ideal technology to provide the transparency we need. In simple words, we
will put the consumer's money in the blockchain network along with the time bound of the job. As soon as the time is 
reached , consumer will check the work and if the work is completed on time money will be transferred into contractor's
account. Else, some deprecation fee will be charged as per the delay from the caution money of the contractor's. There will
be validation check for the claims of both the sides.
There will be review and rating system for the contractors and those with high ratings will be dispayed at top in his
domain. 
Apart from these,  we will allow contractor's to advertise on consumer's profile and will charge nominal fee for that.
